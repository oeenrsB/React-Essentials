## Key Concepts

1. **Create and Use Components**
   - Build reusable components and use them as custom HTML elements inside JSX code.

2. **Configure Components with Props**
   - Pass data to components using `props`.
   - Define the types of props (e.g., using TypeScript or PropTypes).

3. **Use Props or Object Destructuring**
   - Use props directly or destructure them as function parameters for cleaner code.

4. **Output Dynamic Content**
   - Render dynamic content between tags or as attribute values.

5. **Special `children` Prop**
   - Understand and use the `children` prop to pass JSX content into components.

6. **Listen to Events**
   - Handle user interactions like clicks, input changes, etc.

7. **Use State for Updating UI**
   - Use React's `useState` hook to manage and update component state.
   - Note: When state updates, the component function re-executes.

8. **Conditional Content Rendering**
   - Use ternary expressions or logical operators to render content conditionally.

9. **Output Lists Dynamically**
   - Render lists of items dynamically using `.map()`.
